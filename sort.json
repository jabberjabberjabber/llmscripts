If it is personal that should be completely separate from hobbies, technical, or academic texts. You are free to come up with subject matter root topics to sort under as long as there are more than 15% of the total document count associated with that topic and there are at least 2 sub-topics under it. For sub-topics, consider factors such as author, title, creation date, and any other relevant metadata. Create a logical folder structure that would make it easy for a user to navigate and find documents. Return the result as a JSON object where keys are folder paths and values are lists of file paths.",
